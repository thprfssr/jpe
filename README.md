# Javier's Physics Engine

Here, I intend to write my own physics engine in Python. Its first use will be
to help me numerically compute the shape of the hanging gardens at Deuxi√©me
Maison in the Florida International University main campus.

I also used this to simulate the Millikan oil drop experiment for my Advanced
Physics Lab.



# TODO
* Use Geometric Algebra in order to easily deal with rotations
* Implement rigid body dynamics
* Use rigid rods to find the shape of the hanging gardens at FIU
