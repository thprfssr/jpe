# Javier's Physics Engine

Here, I intend to write my own physics engine in Python. Its first use will be
to help me numerically compute the shape of the hanging gardens at Deuxi√©me
Maison in the Florida International University main campus.

I also used this to simulate the Millikan oil drop experiment for my Advanced
Physics Lab.



# TODO
Instead of jumping by discrete time steps, I should use a numerical
integrator. However, I think that will require me to define a particle's
position as a function of time. I will just use the time step method for now,
and worry about integration in the future.
